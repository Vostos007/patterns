\textbf{Size} & 6.5 & 7 & 7.5 & 8 \\

\textbf{Hand circ. (cm)} & 18 & 19 & 20.5 & 21.5 \\

\section{Gauge (after blocking)}
Stockinette stitch: 30 sts and 42 rows = 10×10 cm. Adjust needle size to obtain gauge.

\section{Construction}
Work the gloves in the round from the cuff in stockinette. The instructions are written for the \textit{magic loop} method. When using DPNs, distribute stitches accordingly.

\section{Abbreviations}
\subsection*{Stockinette in the round} knit all stitches every round.\\
\subsection*{1×1 rib} *k1, p1* around.

\section{Make-1 increases}
\subsection{M1R (right-leaning)}
Lift the strand between the stitches from back to front and knit it through the front loop to twist the stitch.

\section{Cast-on}
Cast on the required stitch count for your size plus 1 st to join in the round. Join and divide stitches equally between two needle tips. Needle 1 holds palm side and thumb; needle 2 holds back of hand.

\section{Cuff}
Work 2 rounds of 1×1 rib, then 40 rounds stockinette. Recommended cuff height: 10 cm.

\section{Thumb gusset}
Increase every other round using M1R/M1L to form the thumb gusset on the palm side. After placing the thumb stitches on hold and casting on bridge stitches, you should have 52/56/60/64 sts to continue to the pinky base.
